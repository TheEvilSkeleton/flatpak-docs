Introduction to Flatpak
=======================

Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications across various Linux
distributions. It has been created by developers who have a long history of working on the
Linux desktop, and is run as an independent open source project.


Target audience
---------------

Flatpak can be used by all kinds of desktop applications, and aims to be
as agnostic as possible regarding how applications are built. There are no
requirements regarding which programming languages, build tools, toolkits
or frameworks can be used.

While Flatpak only runs on Linux, it can be used by applications that target
other operating systems, as well as those that are Linux-specific. Applications
can be open source or proprietary (although some distribution services, like
`Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, can have restrictions in this respect).

The only technical requirements made by Flatpak are that applications follow a
small number of freedesktop.org standards, in order to enable desktop integration
(see :doc:`conventions`).

Reasons to use Flatpak
----------------------

Flatpak has some major advantages over most system package managers:

- **Universality**: Flatpak allows applications to be installed and run on virtually any Linux
  distribution. This includes non-GNU distributions, systemd-free distributions,
  distributions with a read-only operating system (OS), and various architectures without the
  developer needing the relevant hardware on hand.
- **Space for innovations**: Flatpak facilitates distribution maintainers to focus on their goals
  to innovate their distribution.
- **Stability**: breakage in a Flatpak application will not risk the system from breaking.
  This is because Flatpak applications and runtimes are contained to not interfere
  with the system altogether.
- **Rootless install**: elevated privileges are not required when installing a Flatpak
  application or a runtime.

Flatpak has some major advantages over other universal approaches to distributing
applications on Linux:

- **Decentralized by design**: while Flatpak does provide a centralized service for distributing
  applications, it also allows decentralized hosting and distribution, so that
  application developers or downstreams can host their own applications and
  application repositories.
- **Desktop integration**: Flatpak also offers native integration for the main Linux desktops, so that
  users can easily browse, install, run and use Flatpak applications through
  their existing desktop environment and tools.
- **Space efficiency**: Flatpak links identical runtime and BaseApp versions to save megabytes
  or even gigabytes worth of storage depending on the amount of applications installed.
- **Delta updates**: Only changed files are downloaded for updates.

Other benefits for developers include:

- **Forward-compatibility**: the same Flatpak application can be run on different versions
  of the same distribution, including versions that haven't been released
  yet. This doesn't require any changes or management by application developers.
- **Bundling**: This allows application developers to ship almost any
  dependency or library as part of their application. This gives complete
  control over which software is used to build applications.
- **Consistent application environments**: because these are the same across
  devices, applications perform as intended. This also makes it easier to
  identify bugs and to do testing.
- **Branches**: this allows developers to ship applications from different
  branches, e.g. ``stable``, ``beta``, etc. while retaining the same name.
- **Maintained platforms:** called runtimes, these contain collections of
  dependencies, which can be used by applications, and which can take a lot
  of the work out of application development.
- **Full control over dependencies**: Flatpak makes it easy to bundle specific
  libraries as part of the app.
